# Random points

## The generic framework 

 * Train a neural network to predict the steering angle (and throttle?) 
   to keep the vehicle on track. 
 * See lecture notes/videos for a generic pipeline  

# TODO next

## In progress

 * Prepare the first data set so that the paths are OK 
 
## TODO  

 * Prepare an AWS environment for training the model
 * Implement a pipeline similar to that in lecture and 
   perform the same test runs that are performed in the lecture
   * Plan for plug and play changeable models (network structures)
 * Implement AlexNet using Keras
 * Re-train the network using the newly implemented Keras 
   implementation
